# Predicting-term-deposit-takers-using-classification
Majority of the bank offers accounts where the owner can withdraw or deposit the money at any time. This makes it difficult for the banks to plan ahead of time about their lending power. To deal with it, banks introduced term deposit accounts where the money will be locked with the bank for a certain period of time. This gave the bank the flexibility to lend money forward. However, one of the major challenges was to identify customers who would be interested in subscribing for the term deposit. In this report, we will introduce you with a dataset related to the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institute. We cleaned and pre-processed the data to prepare it to build a model. Then, we used Random forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms to build model and compare the results.
